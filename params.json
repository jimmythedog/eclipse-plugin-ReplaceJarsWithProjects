{"body":"# eclipse-plugin-replacejarswithprojects\r\n\r\nAn eclipse plugin that replaces referenced jars with workspace projects\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSorry, but manual instructions at the moment...\r\n\r\n1. Import the project into eclipse\r\n1. Right-click on project and select `\"Export...\"`\r\n1. Navigate to `\"Plug-in Development->Deployable plug-ins and fragments\"`\r\n1. Click on `\"Next\"`\r\n1. You now have a couple of ways to install the plugin:\r\n    1. Either:\r\n        1. Use the `\"Archive file\"` option\r\n        1. Once you've created the archive, unzip it into your `eclipse` directory and restart eclipse\r\n    1. Or:\r\n        1. Use the `\"Install into hist: Repository\"` option\r\n        1. Accept the default path e.g. mine is `\"/home/kevin/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/install/\"`\r\n        1. You'll probably get a dialog informing you that you are about to install unsigned code\r\n        1. Then you should get a dialog asking you if wish to restart eclipse\r\n\r\n## Uninstallation\r\n\r\n1. Shutdown eclipse\r\n1. Delete the plugin from the `eclipse/plugins` directory\r\n1. Restart eclipse\r\n1. If the plugin does not uninstall, restart eclipse - this time specifying the `-clean` command line argument to eclipse\r\n\r\n## User Instructions\r\nIn the eclipse Package Explorer window:\r\n\r\n1. Select the project(s) containing the jars you want replacing - Tip: I usually select all projects by entering `Ctrl-A`\r\n1. Right-click to display the pop-up menu\r\n1. Left-click on the `\"Replace jars with workspace projects\"` pop-up menu entry\r\n1. Once the jars have been replaced (or not), a dialog window should appear to inform you what actions were taken. Note: the dialog title is incorrect (displays `\"Problem Occurred\"`) - [this issue has been logged](https://github.com/jimmythedog/eclipse-plugin-ReplaceJarsWithProjects/issues/1)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
