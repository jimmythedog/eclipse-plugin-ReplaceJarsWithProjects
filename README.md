# eclipse-plugin-replacejarswithprojects

An eclipse plugin that replaces referenced jars with workspace projects

## User Instructions
In the eclipse Package Explorer window:

1. Select the project(s) containing the jars you want replacing - Tip: I usually select all projects by entering Ctrl-A
1. right-click to display the pop-up menu
1. left-click on the "Replace jars with workspace projects" pop-up menu entry
1. Once the jars have been replaced (or not), a dialog window should appear to inform you what actions were taken. Note: the dialog title is incorrect (displays "Problem Occurred") - this issue has been logged <https://github.com/jimmythedog/eclipse-plugin-ReplaceJarsWithProjects/issues/1>
